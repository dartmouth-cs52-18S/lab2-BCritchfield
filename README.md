What didn't work:
  This was my first time using js, and it was hard to learn the syntax and how to structure my code
  Took awhile to figure out how to have both a hover and selected (radio box checked) effect. ended up having the same effect for hover
  and unselected, but implemented hover with CSS and unselected with JS--there is probably a more elegant way but this is the first way I 
  got it to work.
  
What worked:
  I feel more confident with CSS and JS now. 
  Flex boxes were super easy after the in class practice and lab 1
  Modal boxes were fairly easy to implement.
